# React Dictionary App
I built a simple React web app that had to utilise an API to fetch the definition of a word. I used WordsAPI from wordsapi.com to fetch the definition of the word.
## Instructions
All you have to do to use this simple app is enter a word in the search bar and it will return a definition for the word.
